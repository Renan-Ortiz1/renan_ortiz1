                    <h1>What is air conditioning?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Air conditioning is an indispensable equipment these days, especially in regions of intense heat. 
                        Although there are several models available on the market, 
                        all operate with the same basic principles to cool the environment and provide a sense of comfort.
                        Below, I’ll show you how an air conditioner works and explain a little about the parts of this appliance.

                <h1>Functioning</h1>
                <p>
                    Air conditioning does not create the cold air alone. In fact, it works by removing heat and moisture from the air to 
                    then transform it into a low temperature air, so there is a process of exchange. For this process to occur
                     quietly, the equipment works with a refrigerant gas (R-22) and three essential mechanical components: 
                     compressor, condenser and evaporator. These parts together can convert the gas into liquid and also the liquid into gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By absorbing heat from the air, the R-22 changes state within the coil of the equipment and will come gas. Then
                    the compressor increases the pressure and temperature to send it to the condenser, which is outside. More
                     hot that the external environment, this gas cools a little and passes to the liquid state quickly due to high pressure.
                     The process continues when a fan blows the rest of the hot air to the street, while the liquid returns to the interior
                      of the equipment and reaches the evaporator, which evaporates it (turning it into gas again) and cools the coil inside the part.
                      Once this is done, another fan blows the air through this coil, causing the ambient temperature to decrease. 
                      The cycle resumes as soon as the gas leaves the evaporator and returns to the compressor.

                <h1>Each component of the air conditioning</h1>
                <p>
                    After learning how air-conditioning works, we should know each of the main parts which are the compressor, condenser and evaporator. 
                    And let’s see how they work:

            <div class="article2">
                <h2>Compressor</h2>
                <p>
                    The compressor can be considered the "heart" of the equipment. 
                    It works by decreasing the volume of the gas and raising its pressure 
                    and temperature for the condensation process.

            <div class="article2">
                <h2>Condenser</h2>
                <p>
                    Condenser helps coolant (R-22) to "steal" heat 
                    collected from the environment, expelling it out and allowing it to
                     it changes state, coming out of gas to liquid.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="article2">
                <h2>Evaporator</h2>
                <p>
                    The evaporator is the final part of the process. The refrigerant
                     passes through its coils, which absorbs the temperature before evaporating it,
                      and a fan blows cold air through the part to reach the exit of the 
                      air conditioning.
